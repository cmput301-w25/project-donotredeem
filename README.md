## Project Description

This Android application allows users to log, track, and share their moods. Users can record mood events with details like emotional state, triggers, and social context. The app provides features for viewing, editing, and filtering mood history, as well as following other usersâ€™ mood updates.

## Key Features

- **Mood Event Tracking**: Effortlessly log and manage your moods by recording the date, time, emotional state, and optional details such as triggers and social context. This system helps users track their emotional well-being over time.
- **Follow and Share**: Stay connected by following others with their permission. Keep up with friends' or peers' mood updates and gain insight into their emotional journeys.
- **Location & Map Views**: Enhance mood entries by adding location data and viewing emotions on an interactive map. This feature provides a visual representation of where specific emotional states occur.
- **Offline Mode**: Seamlessly add, edit, or delete mood entries without an internet connection. Any changes made offline will automatically sync once connectivity is restored.
- **Mood Analytics**: Discover trends in your emotions with MoodCalendar and MoodGraph. Identify patterns, track mood fluctuations, and gain a deeper understanding of your mental well-being over time.
